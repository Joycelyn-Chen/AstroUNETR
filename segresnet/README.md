# segresnet

This folder contains training and testing scripts for a ResNet-based segmentation model. The README below explains the purpose of each file, typical dependencies, and example commands to run them. No hard-coded data paths or secrets are included â€” pass your own paths via CLI arguments or edit the scripts if needed.

Requirements (typical)
- Python 3.8+.
- Common ML and imaging packages: torch, torchvision, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, imageio. Install missing packages via pip, e.g.:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy scipy matplotlib imageio
```

- A GPU is recommended for training; CPU-only is possible but much slower.

Files

- `train.py`
  - Purpose: Train the segmentation model on a dataset. This script typically handles dataset loading, training loop, checkpoint saving, and optional logging (e.g., to stdout, TensorBoard, or a CSV).
  - What it does: loads training/validation data, constructs the model and optimizer, runs epochs, computes loss/metrics, and writes model checkpoints to a specified directory.
  - Run example:

```bash
python3 segresnet/train.py --data-dir /path/to/train_data --save-dir /path/to/checkpoints --epochs 100 --batch-size 4
```

  - Tip: Run `python3 segresnet/train.py --help` to list exact flags and defaults.

- `test.py`
  - Purpose: Evaluate a trained model on a test set or run inference on new data.
  - What it does: loads a model checkpoint, runs forward passes on test images/volumes, computes evaluation metrics (e.g., Dice, IoU), and optionally writes prediction files to disk.
  - Run example:

```bash
python3 segresnet/test.py --data-dir /path/to/test_data --checkpoint /path/to/checkpoint.pth --out-dir /path/to/predictions
```

  - Tip: Use `python3 segresnet/test.py --help` to view script-specific options (e.g., thresholds, batch size, device selection).

Execution tips
- Always inspect `--help` for each script to confirm the exact CLI flags:

```bash
python3 segresnet/train.py --help
python3 segresnet/test.py --help
```

- Use small subsets of your dataset when experimenting to speed up iterations.
- If you run into CUDA out-of-memory errors, reduce `--batch-size` or use gradient accumulation if available.

Troubleshooting & notes
- Missing imports: install the required packages listed above.
- File-format mismatches: confirm the dataset format expected by the script (image folders, NIfTI volumes, HDF5, etc.) and convert inputs as needed.
- Checkpoint compatibility: ensure the model architecture in `train.py` and `test.py` match when loading checkpoints.

Next steps (optional)
- I can open `train.py` and `test.py` and extract exact CLI flags and defaults and then update this README with copy-paste runnable examples.
- I can also generate a minimal `requirements.txt` based on imports in these scripts.
